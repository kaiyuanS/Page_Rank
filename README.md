After applet was lunched, a pop up window will show to ask how many pages you want to show, after input a number and click “OK”, a file picker will pop up so that you can pick the input txt file. If the format of the input is invalid or the dimension of the matrix is smaller than the page need to be output, an error message would show and the applet would be terminated.
